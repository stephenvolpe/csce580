## Communication
We envision several routes of communication for this course:

* The main mode of electronic communication between students and TAs, as well as amongst students, will be through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/sc/spring2019/csce580/home). It is intended for general questions about the course, clarifications about assignments, student questions to each other, discussions about material, and so on. 

* If you need to contact the instructor, you should **email** pjamshid AT cse.sc.edu. 

## Attendance and class participation
Attendance is essential for success in this course. We encourage all students to actively participate in class (by asking or answering questions, sharing experience, discussing project ideas, etc). Active participation will enhance your learning experience and that of the other students. There will be also some quizzes which are designed to emphasize a salient issue in the lecture of the day or in a previous lecture. Another purpose of quizzes is to take attendance. 

## Prerequisites

Prior computer programming experience is expected. Course projects will be in Python. If you do not have previous experience with the language, we expect you to learn the basics very rapidly. 


## Academic Integrity

I would encourage you to discuss or brainstorm with other students or professors about the assignments, projects and homeworks, but submissions should acknowledge all collaborators and sources consulted. We will actively check for code and other kinds of plagiarism (both from current classmates and other available online sources). We trust you all to submit your own work,
but be aware if you plagiarize from other students or online sources, you will simply fail this course. Also, all the potential Honor Code violations will be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity, which has the authority to implement non-academic penalties as described in [STAF 6.25](http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf625.pdf).


## Disabilities Policy

Any student who has a need for accommodation based on the impact of
a documented disability, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services: Phone: 803-777-6142, **Email**: sasds AT mailbox.sc.edu, **Address**: 1523 Greene Street, LeConte College Room 112A, [Web](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/index.php).


## Grading

Overall grades will be based on:
* Course Projects (40%)
* Homework Assignments (10%)
* Midterm (20%)
* Final exam (30%)

The grading scale will be based on:

| Grade        	| Score         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| A     | [90 -- 100]%  	| 
| B+    | [86 -- 90)%       | 
| B 	| [75 -- 86)%       | 
| C+ 	| [70 -- 75)%       | 
| C 	| [60 -- 70)%       | 
| D+ 	| [55 -- 60)%       | 
| D 	| [40 -- 55)%       | 
| F 	| [0 -- 40)%        |
